      <h1>Work with me</h1>

      <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>I am actively seeking motivated and creative students and researchers to work with me in the exciting landscape of <em className='text-hl'>Computer Graphics</em>, <em className='text-hl'>Artificial Intelligence</em>, <em className='text-hl'>Visualization</em>, <em className='text-hl'>Visual Analytics</em>, <em className='text-hl'>Urban Computing</em>, and <em className='text-hl'>Smart Cities</em>. Before reaching out, please have a careful look at my research mission and selected publications to ensure our research interests align. I also highly value students who bring their own ideas, enthusiasm, and passion in these fields. </p>

      <h3>What I Expect:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Passion and curiosity</b> are essential for embarking on the exciting journey of research, whether it's for designing beautiful content, telling impressive stories, or crafting tools you want to use. The ability to cope with uncertainty, writing, reading, presentation and communication skills are essential. While you don’t need to master all skills at the start, my role is to help you develop them into strengths. I look for signs of potential to grow in these areas.</li>
        <li><b>Technical capabilities</b> to develop research prototypes and interactive systems (e.g., visualization with d3.js and three.js, 3D/immersive prototyping with Unity, front-end development with TypeScript and Vue/React, AI-oriented development with Python, and LLM-based application development) are encouraged. Prior knowledge in computer graphics, artificial intelligence, visualization, visual analytics, urban computing, and smart cities is highly valued in your application. A solid foundation (e.g., from related majors such as computer science, electronic computing, and media technology) and a willingness to learn are key—skills not yet mastered can be definitely developed during the course of your study.</li>
      </ul>

      {/* <h3>For PhD Applications:</h3>
      <p>I am currently <b className='text-hl'>offering funded PhD student positions</b> all year around.
